/**
 * The League chat feed: typed entries over one per-league chronology (#434).
 *
 * ADR 0012 keeps League chat and Draft activity as SEPARATE record types that
 * are PRESENTED as one chronologically ordered feed, sharing a single
 * transactional per-league sequence. This module is the League-chat half of
 * that feed: it reads `chat_messages` rows and shapes each as a typed feed
 * entry carrying its authoritative sequence position (`seq`, the row's
 * `feed_seq`). Draft activity will add its own kind against the same sequence
 * in a later slice; the `type` field is what lets one ordered read distinguish
 * them without inventing a fake chat author for a Draft event.
 *
 * The feed is a READ over the source table, never a copy of it. Nothing here
 * denormalises a message into a second store, so when retention or account
 * deletion removes a `chat_messages` row (server/services/retention.service.js,
 * privacy.service.js) the entry simply leaves the feed and its `seq` becomes a
 * gap - exactly ADR 0012's "removed rather than a retained copy", achieved by
 * having no copy to leave behind.
 *
 * Identity is Team-only (CONTEXT.md: Team identity; teamIdentity.js): an entry
 * carries `teamId` / `teamName` and never the author's account. A message from
 * a manager who has since left the league reads back with null Team identity
 * rather than dropping out, because the join behind the read is LEFT.
