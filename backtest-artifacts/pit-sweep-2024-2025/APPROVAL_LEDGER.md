# APPROVAL_LEDGER.md — the external, append-only approval record

Study id: `pit-sweep-2024-2025`.

**Why this file exists** (independent implementation review, round 2,
critical finding): approvals were previously recorded *inside*
`PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` itself, in its own section 10 approval table.
Recording an approval in the approved document **changes the document's
bytes**, so the hash the approver authenticated no longer matches the file
that carries the approval. That is not a paperwork detail — it means the
deviations from the sealed preregistration that the spec authorizes have no
authenticated approval attached to them.

**The rule this file establishes, going forward:**

1. An approval is recorded **here**, never in the approved document.
2. The approved document is **not edited** after the hash is taken.
3. Each row records the exact SHA-256 of the bytes that were reviewed, who
   approved, when, and the precise scope of what was approved.
4. This file is **append-only**. A superseded row is never edited or
   deleted; a new row is appended and the old one marked superseded.

## Current document hashes (recorded 2026-08-02)

| document | SHA-256 of current bytes | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PREREGISTRATION.md` | `653d98841a5c8e19af2d2d0d94ce58d677223dddee2b1433486a3dee8e3f802e` | SEALED, never edited since Phase 0 — hash is of the sealed bytes |
| `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` | `0661eafc951406d22c74fe45a47f8a789d025ab9ae74d583a65148f9866cc2eb` | **APPROVAL CHAIN BROKEN — see below** |

## The broken approval chain, stated plainly

The independent statistical review of revision 13 authenticated SHA-256
`25DFFCEC77EB5DFE17150020C04465B546F0584919916FD686CCFE77FA17258F`. The
current bytes of `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` hash to
`0661eafc951406d22c74fe45a47f8a789d025ab9ae74d583a65148f9866cc2eb`.

**These are different documents.** The divergence was caused by edits made
*after* that approval, to record the approvals themselves in the document's
own section 10 table and preamble (see the conversation record of
2026-08-02).

**This cannot be repaired retroactively, and I am not going to pretend
otherwise.** The bytes that hashed to `25DFFCEC…` were overwritten. There is
no copy of them: the file is untracked in git (`git status` shows it as `??`,
never committed), so there is no object in the repository to recover them
from, and no backup was taken before the edits. I cannot reconstruct them
exactly — the edits were not byte-reversible, and reconstructing them "close
enough" would produce a *different* document that I would then be asserting
was the approved one, which is precisely the failure this ledger exists to
prevent.

**What this means concretely:** every deviation from the sealed
preregistration that `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` authorizes — the §4.2 AND
rule, the 0.50→0.30 falsifiability floor, the "either identity assertion
suffices to void" resolution, the (f) no-finite-bound inconclusive mapping,
the S3 non-estimable deviation — currently rests on an approval of bytes
that no longer exist.

### Required remedy (only the user/approver can perform it)

The current bytes must be **re-approved as they now stand**, by the same
approval chain that approved revision 13:

1. Independent statistical re-review of the current bytes
   (`0661eafc95…`), confirming the substantive content is unchanged from
   what was approved as revision 13 and that the post-approval edits were
   confined to recording approvals.
2. User re-approval of the S3 deviation and of the remainder, against
   `0661eafc95…`.
3. Both recorded **in this file**, not in the spec document.

Until that is done, Gate 0's fourth-approval condition cannot be satisfied
regardless of the implementation's own quality, because the spec the
implementation is being verified against is not itself authenticated.

## Approval rows

*(Append only. No row is ever edited or deleted.)*

| # | document | SHA-256 reviewed | approver | date | scope | status |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` | `25DFFCEC77EB5DFE17150020C04465B546F0584919916FD686CCFE77FA17258F` | independent statistical review | 2026-08-02 | revision 13, sections 3-8 | **SUPERSEDED — reviewed bytes no longer exist (see above)** |
| 2 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` | `25DFFCEC77EB5DFE17150020C04465B546F0584919916FD686CCFE77FA17258F` | user | 2026-08-02 | S3 non-estimable deviation | **SUPERSEDED — reviewed bytes no longer exist** |
| 3 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` | `25DFFCEC77EB5DFE17150020C04465B546F0584919916FD686CCFE77FA17258F` | user | 2026-08-02 | remainder of revision 13; Gate 2 implementation only, no candidate execution | **SUPERSEDED — reviewed bytes no longer exist** |

**No row below this line is filled in.** Rows 4+ are reserved for the
re-approval described above, and for the Gate 2 independent implementation
review, once each actually occurs. They must be added by, or at the explicit
direction of, the approver — never pre-filled in anticipation.
