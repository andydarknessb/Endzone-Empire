# APPROVAL_LEDGER.md — the external, append-only approval record

Study id: `pit-sweep-2024-2025`.

**Why this file exists** (independent implementation review, round 2,
critical finding): approvals were previously recorded *inside*
`PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` itself, in its own section 10 approval table.
Recording an approval in the approved document **changes the document's
bytes**, so the hash the approver authenticated no longer matches the file
that carries the approval. That is not a paperwork detail — it means the
deviations from the sealed preregistration that the spec authorizes have no
authenticated approval attached to them.

**The rule this file establishes, going forward:**

1. An approval is recorded **here**, never in the approved document.
2. The approved document is **not edited** after the hash is taken.
3. Each row records the exact SHA-256 of the bytes that were reviewed, who
   approved, when, and the precise scope of what was approved.
4. This file is **append-only**. A superseded row is never edited or
   deleted; a new row is appended and the old one marked superseded.

## Current document hashes (recorded 2026-08-02)

| document | SHA-256 of current bytes | status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PREREGISTRATION.md` | `653d98841a5c8e19af2d2d0d94ce58d677223dddee2b1433486a3dee8e3f802e` | SEALED, never edited since Phase 0 — hash is of the sealed bytes |
| `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` | see the anchor commit for the revision under review — do NOT treat any hash in this file as "the current bytes" | **NO APPROVAL IN FORCE, AND NOTHING IS AUTHORIZED.** Revision 13's chain is broken (below). Its successor blob `0661eafc95…` was REJECTED (R1); revision 14 (`49620ec2…`) R2; revision 15 (`e507d0c4…`) R3; revision 16 (`8bd263cd…`) R4; revision 17 (`f7d6b31f…`) R5. **Revision 18 awaits all three fresh approvals.** Gate 2 implementation work is not authorized; candidate-cell execution is not authorized. |

**Hash the BLOB, not the working file.** This repository has
`core.autocrlf=true` and no `.gitattributes` covering these artifacts, so a
checkout on Windows rewrites the working copy's line endings and it will
not match the recorded hash. The committed blob is unaffected. Always use:

```
git show <anchor-commit>:backtest-artifacts/pit-sweep-2024-2025/PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md | sha256sum
```

## The broken approval chain, stated plainly

The independent statistical review of revision 13 authenticated SHA-256
`25DFFCEC77EB5DFE17150020C04465B546F0584919916FD686CCFE77FA17258F`. Its
immediate successor blob hashed to
`0661eafc951406d22c74fe45a47f8a789d025ab9ae74d583a65148f9866cc2eb`.
**(`0661eafc95…` is NOT current and has not been since revision 13's
successor was rejected as R1 — see the corrective entry below. It is named
here only to identify the divergence.)**

**These are different documents.** The divergence was caused by edits made
*after* that approval, to record the approvals themselves in the document's
own section 10 table and preamble (see the conversation record of
2026-08-02).

**This cannot be repaired retroactively, and I am not going to pretend
otherwise.** The bytes that hashed to `25DFFCEC…` were overwritten. There is
no copy of them: the file is untracked in git (`git status` shows it as `??`,
never committed), so there is no object in the repository to recover them
from, and no backup was taken before the edits. I cannot reconstruct them
exactly — the edits were not byte-reversible, and reconstructing them "close
enough" would produce a *different* document that I would then be asserting
was the approved one, which is precisely the failure this ledger exists to
prevent.

**What this means concretely:** every deviation from the sealed
preregistration that `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` authorizes — the §4.2 AND
rule, the 0.50→0.30 falsifiability floor, the "either identity assertion
suffices to void" resolution, the (f) no-finite-bound inconclusive mapping,
the S3 non-estimable deviation — currently rests on an approval of bytes
that no longer exist.

### Required remedy (only the user/approver can perform it)

The **then-current** bytes had to be re-approved as they stood, by the same
approval chain that approved revision 13:

1. Independent statistical re-review of the then-current bytes.
2. User re-approval of the S3 deviation and of the remainder, against those
   same bytes.
3. Both recorded **in this file**, not in the spec document.

**Status of that remedy:** step 1 has been attempted five times and has
REJECTED every time (R1-R5), so steps 2 and 3 have never been reached. The
document has been corrected after each rejection, so the bytes needing
approval are no longer revision 13's successor - they are whatever the
latest anchor commit carries. **Substituting a specific hash into steps 1-2
above would go stale on the next revision, which is exactly the failure the
corrective entry below addresses; the remedy is therefore stated without
one.**

Until that is done, Gate 0's fourth-approval condition cannot be satisfied
regardless of the implementation's own quality, because the spec the
implementation is being verified against is not itself authenticated.

## Review history — NOT approvals

*(Kept deliberately separate from the approval rows below. A review that
did not approve must never occupy an approval row. Append only.)*

| # | document | SHA-256 reviewed | reviewer | date | outcome |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` rev 13-successor | `0661eafc951406d22c74fe45a47f8a789d025ab9ae74d583a65148f9866cc2eb` (git blob `f6c398c5aeb900be8f15a04856c2718acf372a89`, anchored in commit `03a36768bf04106425b5a308f56c43fcaeb61b1a`) | independent statistical re-review | 2026-08-02 | **REJECT** — four blockers: (1) component-(f) falsifiability used pooled seasonwide mean `\|b\|` where the estimand is a median of week-level deltas; (2) permutation control under-specified (PRNG, shuffle, canonical player ordering, state consumption, blockwise construction) and therefore able to change the run-level VOID decision; (3) reducer not formally total; (4) player-week × salt catastrophic veto was an unlabeled substantive amendment. **No approval rows were appended for this hash, at the reviewer's explicit direction.** |
| R2 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` rev 14 | `49620ec20fc35e76c5029f266494fa099371bb34ca5a0e4a0d83af86bf8b6739` (git blob `ee6800ecdb4484f5cc599ef6a67c1a77fc9f1068`, anchored in commit `152f225bb8691cc54488dd79bfc0f8604e89ba7a`) | independent statistical review | 2026-08-02 | **REJECT** — five blockers: (1) the optional `0.30` shortcut is not rounding-equivalent to the transformed-bound comparison; (2) permutation still under-specified (complete mulberry32 transition, `b = 0…9999`, hash-input encoding, source-to-target assignment direction); (3) no Level-3 `not-applicable` state, and intentionally absent endpoints risked being reported as Level-4 `missing`; (4) approval language contradictory (Gate 2 claimed authorized; section 10 read as supplying approval); (5) outcome-changing rules misclassified as mechanical — permutation construction, harmful-boundary definitions, inclusive wide-straddle contacts, zero-margin straddle disabling. **Accepted as statistically coherent**: median-aligned weekly (f) bound and even-week aggregation; inclusive unfalsifiability equality; Cartesian veto completeness and independent retention; S3 deviation disclosure; wide-straddle quantiles and natural-sign mechanics; activation, Level 5, control baseline, both identity assertions. **No approval rows or user attestations were warranted for this hash.** |

| R3 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` rev 15 | `e507d0c453802cbf785402462de898a906ee8dc0667b844e0a9f4e900e97da15` (git blob `4f5f21a8bbb8b95c432816311f27bd1a7c2e6937`, anchored in commit `da4b205521e3662bbf3dd51388b643d8912c8af3`) | independent statistical review | 2026-08-03 | **REJECT** — two substantive blockers: (1) component (f) contradicted itself — the evaluability gate correctly used only the transformed `0.025` comparison, but other sections still mandated a `0.30` falsifiability-floor comparison; (2) component (f) veto status not total — one rule required independently retained `vetoed` while Level 3 ordered `missing > vetoed` with exactly one status, so a `missing` sibling endpoint silently masked a fired veto. Plus documentary corrections (stale revision-14 references, an obsolete instruction identifying `0661…` as current, and an over-broad "strictly more likely to veto" claim). **Passed review**: fully pinned permutation, not-applicable reducer behavior, median-aligned weekly bound, Cartesian completeness, substantive classifications, activation, selection, control baseline, identity assertions. **No approval row or user attestation was warranted for this blob.** |

| R4 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` rev 16 | `8bd263cd133c7dcea533c7ae7bd2cc9efea1a3ec42340aa1fb4b9f467d7c4396` (git blob `9dc2a70dbd709a4fb4f5b65f91184a72493228e2`, anchored in commit `906dfe26667d237734d9eb8f253d8e89c0c27fd1`) | independent statistical review | 2026-08-03 | **REJECT** — two blockers: (1) revision and approval routing still contradictory — several sections called revision 14 current or awaiting review, and two approval questions still pointed at historical §10 despite the document declaring the external ledger solely authoritative; (2) the salted hash construction `scoringHash + ':' + salt` (§3.2) was misclassified as mechanical — it was never sealed, and delimiter/order alternatives produce different seeds and potentially different verdicts. **Confirmed corrected**: transformed `0.025` gate, disclosure-only `0.30`, independent catastrophic-veto flag, narrowed Cartesian comparison, total reducer, complete permutation, activation, selection, control baseline, identity assertions. **No approval row or user attestation was warranted for this blob.** |

| R5 | `PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` rev 17 | `f7d6b31f6ba338fdecaea40187b27300a66808f176234b28646250508475397e` (git blob `281b1f0e707c510b557b114174deae6003ae6b19`, anchored in commit `6c1a873b8d0149319b92879bc9f6cdc60eeb3b37`) | independent statistical review | 2026-08-03 | **REJECT** — single blocker: §3.2 promised a pinned salt-composition test vector but supplied no literal inputs or expected output, so the required test had nothing to assert against. Non-blocking cleanup: rename §4.5 to "Applies to every bootstrap inequality"; remove a duplicated revision-16 heading and a dangling sentence fragment near the preamble (both introduced by revision 17's own splice). **All other statistical and approval-routing provisions passed review.** **No approval row or user attestation was warranted for this blob.** |

### CORRECTIVE ENTRY — superseding obsolete "current bytes" instructions

**Any instruction anywhere in this repository or its history that
identifies `0661eafc95…` as "the current bytes" of
`PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` is OBSOLETE and superseded by this entry.**
That hash was revision 13's successor blob; it was rejected as R1, and has
since been superseded twice more (revision 14 → `49620ec2…`, rejected as
R2; revision 15 → `e507d0c4…`, rejected as R3). **No hash recorded in this
file should ever be treated as "current"** — the current revision is
whichever blob the most recent anchor commit carries, and it is identified
there, not here. This file records what was REVIEWED, not what exists now.

Revision 18 is the response to R5. **It is awaiting ALL THREE fresh
approvals** — the independent statistical review, the user's S3-deviation
attestation, and the user's remainder attestation — none of which has been
issued against it or against any predecessor whose bytes still exist. No
approval attaches to revision 18 until each is issued and recorded in the
approval rows below.

**Approval routing is exclusive to this file.** No section of
`PHASE5_EXECUTION_SPEC.md` records, supplies, evidences, or requests an
approval; every approval question in that document routes here. A future
edit that reintroduces an approval question pointing at the spec's own
section 10 reintroduces the hash-invalidating practice this ledger exists
to end.

review, once each actually occurs. They must be added by, or at the explicit
direction of, the approver — never pre-filled in anticipation.
